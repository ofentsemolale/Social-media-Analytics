# Social-media-Analytics
Analyzes Social media performances on consumers 
This Project starts of with a problem statement on what needs to be solved, the project analyzes social media performances based on consumer consumption. It has been broken down into seven queries along with seven visualizations that tell the story of the query. The query has KPI's stated in the pdf/word document on what needs to be retrived using SQL and what needs to be seen using PowerBI. I used AI when coming to calculating the correlation coeffiecient as MySQL WorkBench didn't provide me with an inbuilt command. The query closes of by stipulating how the targets were met and if the targets were met.
